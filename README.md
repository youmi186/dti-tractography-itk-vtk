# DTI Tractography and Visualization using ITK and VTK

This repository presents a simplified, demonstrative version of a white matter fiber tractography and visualization system implemented in C++ using ITK and VTK. The project was developed as part of the CS6357 course at Vanderbilt University and is shared here strictly for academic portfolio purposes.

## 🔍 Overview

- **ITK Component**: Extracts principal eigenvectors and FA values from diffusion tensor images (DTI), and performs fiber tracking using voxel-based and slice-based seeding.
- **VTK Component**: Provides interactive 3D rendering of tractography results, supporting continuous space visualization and mouse-based seeding.

This version contains only illustrative code samples and **does not include**:
- CMake or build scripts
- Full datasets
- Classroom-specific templates or submission files
